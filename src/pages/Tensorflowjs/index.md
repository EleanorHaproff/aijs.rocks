# Now you can do machine learning in JavaScript!

## The popular machine learning framework Tensorflow has been completely rewritten in JavaScript

[TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) is big news for JavaScript Developers.

For a gentle introduction to TensorFlow.js check out [this blog](https://medium.com/tensorflow/a-gentle-introduction-to-tensorflow-js-dba2e5257702)

## You can do three things with TensorFlow.js:

### Develop ML with JavaScript
Use flexible and intuitive APIs to build and train models from scratch using the low-level JavaScript linear algebra library or the high-level layers API

### Run Existing Models

Use TensorFlow.js model converters to run pre-existing TensorFlow models right in the browser or under Node.js.

### Retrain Existing Models

Retrain pre-existing ML models using sensor data connected to the browser, or other client-side data.
